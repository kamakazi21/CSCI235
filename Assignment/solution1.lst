SQL> /* We would like to implement a relational database to store information about real estate properties
SQL>   and owners of real estate properties.
SQL>
SQL>   To simplify a design, we consider only two types of real properties: stand-alone houses and blocks 
SQL>   of land.
SQL>
SQL>   Both types of real estate properties are described by a full address that consists of city, street, 
SQL>   building number/lot number, and area.
SQL>
SQL>   Stand-alone houses are additionally described by the total number of bedrooms.
SQL>
SQL>   Stand-alone houses and blocks of land are uniquely identified by a group of attributes city, street, 
SQL>   and building number/lot number.
SQL>
SQL>   The real estate properties are owned by the owners. A typical owner is described by first name, 
SQL>   last name, and mobile phone number. An owner is identified by a mobile phone number.
SQL>
SQL>   Whenever a real estate property is put on a market the owners provide information about their asking 
SQL>   price for such property.                                                                               */
